Installation instructions.

At the moment, there is no convenient method to make and install this
plugin. If you want to use it, you have to download the pidgin 
development librarys, make the .so file, and move it to the plugin
directory.

When I get around to it,(right) I will try to make it a little bit more
friendly.
