Installation instructions.

In order to build this plugin, you need to have pidgin(or finch) and the libpurple development packages installed. For debian/ubuntu that should just require:

	sudo apt-get install libpurple-dev pidgin


After you have those, you should be able to just run the following commands in the directory where you found this file.

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

Apology:
	I haven't actually done this install on a debian system, I built it in gentoo, but from what I read, this should work.
