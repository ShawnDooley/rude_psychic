Installation instructions.

In order to build this plugin, you need to have autoconf, libtool, and libpurple-dev. Also, it would make sense to have pidgin also, so in debian/ubuntu, run the following command:

	sudo apt-get install libpurple-dev pidgin autoconf libtool

That should make sure you have all of the tools you need.
After you have those, you should be able to just run the following commands in the directory where you found this file.

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

For windows there is no formal installer yet, but you should be able to copy the rude_psychic.dll file into the following directory.
If you have pidgin installed already, the .purple directory should already exist, buy you will probably have to create the plugin
directory and then copy the file into it.

	C:\Users\(your username)\AppData\Roaming\.purple\plugins

After the installation you will need to restart pidgin, and activate Rude Psychic in the plugins menu (not "Psychic Mode"). 
That should be it. Enjoy annoying all of the people who message you.
