Installation instructions.

In order to build this plugin, you need to have autoconf, libtool, and libpurple-dev. Also, it would make sense to have pidgin also, so in debian/ubuntu, run the following command:

	sudo apt-get install libpurple-dev pidgin autoconf libtool

That should make sure you have all of the tools you need.
After you have those, you should be able to just run the following commands in the directory where you found this file.

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

Installation for windows/mac are still in the works.
