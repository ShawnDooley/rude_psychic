This plugin is a modification of the Phychic Mode plugin for Pidgin.

Install instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.

FYI!!
The windows dll is a version behind the linux version. It does not yet include the option to have custom messages for each contact on your list. I will build a new windows version whein I get back to a windows based computer.

This plugin sends an automated instant message to people when they start typing to you. It requires that they allow other people to see when they are typing. It will only send the automated message if you do not currently have an open conversation with that person.
There are a few default messages listed below, otherwise, you can set a custom message right clicking on the buddy in your buddy list, or through the menus in a conversation window.




The default messages are as follows

Regular mode:
-------------------------
Hi, how are you doing?
So, what are you up to?
Fine thanks, and you?
I see you!
I have no idea.

Rude Mode:
------------------------
What the (*&%) do you want?
I don't care?
La la la! I'm not listening!
Why do you think I care?
Who the #$%^ are you?
